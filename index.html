      <h1>My Career Change From Mechanical to IT</h1>
    <h2>How I Got Into IT</h2>
    
        <p>It was during 2021 when everyone was devasted about the ongoing pandemic, when a good friend recommended an IT learnership(National diploma) which was sponsored by her company. As someone who has been always fascinated by the IT industry, I took the leap of faith and submitted my documents and the rest was history. My IT journey started well as I had bit of background of how a computer system works.</p>
        
        
        <p>However although I had a bit of background certain modules were introduced which I was not familiar with, the hardest part was doing most of the work remotely via Teams as we couldn't hold in-person lessons. That made things a bit tricky as I couldn't grasp well certain topics as I would if was in-person lessons. Nevertheless I managed to set aside time in order to fully understand each concept to the core.</p>

Nevertheless I managed to set aside time in order to fully understand each concept to the core.</p>
      <h2><u>Skills Which I Gained</u></h2>
      
        <p>During the 12 months learnership I gained a lot of theoretical and practical experience as an IT Technician , My biggest achievement was being able to perform given tasks without any supervision, from the setup of IT infrastructure,server anagement to securing the network, the experience gained enabled me to start my own small tech company which deals with IT support.  Fast forward 2022 September I started doing online certificates in Cyber Security and Data Science, I completed those certificates and I then finally got a chance to be accepted by ALX for their 12 months software engineering program</p>
    <h2><u>How The Journey Has Been</u></h2>
    <p>Up to thus far my journey in the IT has been filled with both heartache and joy, I am continuously  growing  my programming skills. I have a strong community of developers whom we always push each other as much as we can, the end goal is to specialize as full-stack developer however for now I am focusing on the front-end while working my way up to the back-end.</p>
    <h2><u>My Advice To People Who Wish To Become Programmer's</u></h2>
    <p>Therefore to anyone who is thinking of career change I would advise IT industry, as the world has progressively approached 4th industrial revolution, technology is tremendously improving therefore it would make sense to migrate to IT.</p>
